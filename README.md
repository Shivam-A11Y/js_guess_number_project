# js_guess_number_project
This is my first Java Script Project, that I've made with the combination of HTML, CSS, Java Script and some concept of Accessible Rich Internet Application (ARIA). and In this project, this is like a game, where you have to enter a random number from 1 to 20 and check is it matching the Secret Number or not?
